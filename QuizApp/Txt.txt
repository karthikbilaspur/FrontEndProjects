Exciting Project Alert!

I'm thrilled to share my latest project - a Quiz App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This interactive app allows users to test their knowledge on frontend and backend development, with questions ranging from easy to hard.

The app features:

A user-friendly interface with a selection of quiz types (frontend, backend, or both)

A dynamic question display with options and a scoring system

Previous and next buttons for easy navigation

A restart button to try again

I've used JSON files to store the quiz questions and answers, making it easy to update and add new content. The JavaScript code handles the quiz logic, ensuring a seamless user experience.



Future enhancements:

1. Add more questions and topics: Expand the quiz content to cover more areas of frontend and backend development, such as full-stack development, DevOps, and more.

2.  Implement user authentication and score tracking: Allow users to create accounts and track their progress, including scores and completed quizzes.

3. Create a leaderboard: Display top scorers and encourage competition among users.

4.  Add a timer and score penalty: Introduce a time limit for each question and penalize users for incorrect answers.

5. Make the app mobile-friendly and PWA-compatible: Ensure the app is optimized for mobile devices and can be installed as a progressive web app (PWA).

6.  Integrate with social media platforms: Allow users to share their scores and compete with friends on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

Note :-  I urge everyone to not just like the post but also tell in form of comments what else i could have done. I am on a mission to make 30projects 30 days. The catch is I will be using only #HTML, #CSS and #JS for this endeviour. So also give me ideas of next projects   Looking forward for your suggestions.
