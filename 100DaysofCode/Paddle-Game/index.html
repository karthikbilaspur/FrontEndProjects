        <h2>How to Play:</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the most chaotic Pong game you've ever encountered! This isn't your grandma's Pong; it's a mashup of epic proportions with a ton of features designed to keep you on your toes.</p>
        <h3>Controls:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arrow Up/Down:</strong> Move your paddle.</li>
            <li><strong>Spacebar:</strong> Pause/Unpause the game.</li>
            <li><strong>Z:</strong> Dash (move instantly up or down) or Shoot Bullets (if you have no dash cooldown).</li>
            <li><strong>X:</strong> Activate Rage Shot (when Rage meter is full).</li>
            <li><strong>1, 2, 3:</strong> Select upgrades from the upgrade menu when it appears.</li>
            <li><strong>Touch (Mobile):</strong> Drag your finger on the screen to move your paddle.</li>
            <li><strong>R (Game Over):</strong> Restart the game.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Key Features:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Power-ups:</strong> Small colored squares will appear randomly. Hit them with the ball for temporary buffs like a bigger paddle, slowed balls, or even spawning multiple balls!</li>
            <li><strong>Portals:</strong> Two purple-outlined circles. The ball can enter one and instantly exit the other side of the arena.</li>
            <li><strong>Gravity Well:</strong> A central cyan circle that pulls the ball towards it, altering its trajectory.</li>
            <li><strong>Boss Battle:</strong> After scoring 5 points, a boss appears on the right side. Hit it with the ball or your bullets to defeat it! Watch out for its health phases.</li>
            <li><strong>Bullets & Rage:</strong> Use 'Z' to shoot! Build up 'Rage' by making combos and hitting the ball. High rage increases bullet power and affects your dash cooldown.</li>
            <li><strong>Rage Shot:</strong> When your 'Rage' meter is full, press 'X' for a super-powered shot that sends the ball flying at extreme speed!</li>
            <li><strong>Combo System:</strong> Keep hitting the ball without the AI scoring to build up your combo. Higher combos can lead to ball mutations!</li>
            <li><strong>Ball Mutations:</strong> Balls can randomly become "Ghost" balls (pass through things?) or "Seeking" balls (gently home in on paddles).</li>
            <li><strong>Upgrade System:</strong> Every 3 points you score, a menu will pop up, letting you choose between powerful permanent upgrades like a bigger paddle, multi-ball, or rage boosts.</li>
            <li><strong>Slow-motion:</strong> Time briefly slows down when the ball is very close to your paddle, giving you precious milliseconds to react.</li>
            <li><strong>Destructible Walls:</strong> The top and bottom walls can be damaged by ball hits. Break them to create new openings and strategies!</li>
            <li><strong>AI Buffs:</strong> The AI isn't left out! It might occasionally get temporary buffs like increased speed or a larger paddle.</li>
            <li><strong>Arena Effects:</strong> Random global modifiers like "Low Gravity," "High Friction," or "Paddle Clamp" will activate, changing the entire game's physics for a short period.</li>
            <li><strong>Ball Splitting:</strong> The boss might sometimes split the ball when hit, adding more chaos!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Survive the chaos, master the mechanics, and defeat the Boss to claim victory!</p>
